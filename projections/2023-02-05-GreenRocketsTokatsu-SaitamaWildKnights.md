# Saitama Wild Knights at Green Rockets Tokatsu

# Club Level Predictions


The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model has a prediction of 0.013, which translates to predicting Saitama Wild Knights to win by 39.3.

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (simiar to a Glicko system), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.

# Player Level Predictions


Treating teams instead as an entity made up of the currently active players, I have ratings for each player in an altogether different system. These can be combined to form team ratings once teamsheets are announced, weighting starters a bit higher than the reserves. Before teamsheets are announced (and added here), team ratings are calculated as an average of recent team ratings.
## Predictions without Teamsheets

### Saitama Wild Knights (~1644.51) at Green Rockets Tokatsu (~1433.61)

#### Prediction: Saitama Wild Knights by 17.1
