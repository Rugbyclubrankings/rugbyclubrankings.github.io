# Club Level Predictions


The first set of predictions treats a club as the smallest object, as the club develops its members, organizes a gameplan, and deploys its players as needed for each match. This club model has a prediction of 0.518, which translates to predicting Sharks to win by 0.8.

Each club has a rating and a rating deviation (simiar to a Glicko system), and expected performances can be generated. This allows for simulated matches and spreads like the ones below.

# Player Level Predictions


Treating teams instead as an entity made up of the currently active players, I have ratings for each player in an altogether different system. These can be combined to form team ratings once teamsheets are announced, weighting starters a bit higher than the reserves. Before teamsheets are announced (and added here), team ratings are calculated as an average of recent team ratings.
## Predictions without Teamsheets

### Stormers (~1557.16) at Sharks (~1602.45)

#### Prediction: Sharks by 8.5


Sharks by 4.5 on a neutral pitch
