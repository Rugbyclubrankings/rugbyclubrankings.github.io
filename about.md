## About This Site

As an amateur rugby player and a less amateur statistician in the US, this is a project that has been in the back of my mind for a very long time. Most of our sports media is littered with statistics and projections, to the point where watching any game without them can be a strange experience. Whenever I was able to watch a game, the stats gathered were mostly descriptive - who made the most tackles, or the most meters, or which forward pack weighed more. It seemed little thought was given to the prescriptive data that could indicate which team or player had the edge in a given situation. And I, somewhat foolishly, thought that wouldn't be too complicated a problem to explore.

Turns out it's a bit complicated. I have gathered data for most of the professional men's 15s rugby union competitions, and generated ratings for each team and each player. I have reviews of matches, and projected winners and spreads for future matches. Eventually, I hope to improve the accuracies to make them actually useful predictions. We'll see how complicated it gets
